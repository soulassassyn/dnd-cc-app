                Oh no! It looks like you've stumbled upon a 404 error page. 
                Don't worry, it's not because you're lost in some dark and 
                dangerous dungeon (although that would certainly be an adventure).
            </p>
            <p>
                Instead, it looks like you've taken a wrong turn somewhere on our 
                website. But don't despair, a brave adventurer like yourself is sure 
                to find your way eventually. Just be sure to watch out for traps and 
                pesky goblins along the way.
            </p>

                And remember, if all else fails, you can always use a locate object 
                spell to find what you're looking for. Good luck on your journey!
